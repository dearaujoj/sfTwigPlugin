**I have taken over maintenance of this Symfony 1.{3,4} plugin from Henrik Bj√∏rnskov, as he's now working Symfony2 exlusively**

My current focus is to:

1. Update Twig to the latest stable version (1.9.2), and then keep a
   tighter lock on the main project
2. Work on the documentation. We're using this at my workplace on our
   Symfony 1.4 projects, but I remember it was a bit painful to get
working
3.  Better test coverage.

All pull requests welcome.
